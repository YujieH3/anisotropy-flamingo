# Anisotropy FLAMINGO Project
The project study the anisotropy of the universe with galaxy scaling relations. We use the FLAMINGO simulation to create thousands of mock lightcones and see what level of cosmic anisotropy we can expect in a LCDM universe. The study is a continuation of the observational work done in [Migkas et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...636A..15M/abstract) and [Migkas et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...649A.151M/abstract). The universe might look more like a ðŸŒ° than a ðŸŽ±.
