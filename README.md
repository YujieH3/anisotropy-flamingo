# Anisotropy FLAMINGO Project
![Work in Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20progress-yellow)

The project study the anisotropy of the universe with galaxy scaling relations. We use the FLAMINGO simulation to create thousands of mock lightcones and see what level of cosmic anisotropy we can expect in a LCDM universe. 

The work is a continuation of observational studies from:
- [Migkas et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...636A..15M/abstract)
- [Migkas et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...649A.151M/abstract)

The universe might look more like a ðŸŒ° than a ðŸŽ±.

## To-Do List
- [ ] Bootstrapping + chi-square bulk flow analysis
- [ ] Joint H0 MCMC analysis of Lx-T and Ysz-T relations
- [ ] Joint H0 MCMC analysis of Lx-T, Ysz-T, and Mgas-T relations
- [x] All lightcones done, stop the cron job.
- [x] Write a batch script to run bootstrapping without fixing directions but scan a small region.
- [x] Run MCMC bulk flow analysis
- [x] Submit batch_best_fit.sh
- [x] Submit H0 chi-square + bootstrapping on the cluster.
- [x] Write a batch script to run the H0 chi-square + bootstrapping analysis on the cluster.
- [x] Rewrite scan-bootstrap to scan-bootstrap-fix-lonlat to bootstrap only on max difference of lon and lat.
- [x] Submit H0 MCMC analysis on the cluster.
- [x] Write a batch script to run the H0 MCMC analysis on the cluster.
- [x] lightcone0000 - 0004 are corrupted, remember to redo the sample creation on them.
- [x] Make scripts/_1_combine_lightcone.py, scripts/_2_band_patch.py, scripts/_3_rotate_lightcone.py take individual files as input instead of a directory, easier to run in parallel with lightcone creation script (scripts/__fast_make_lightcone_mpi.py).
- [x] Set up a cron job to copy to backup for further operations every hour.
- [x] Lightcone debugged and running on the cluster.
