# Anisotropy FLAMINGO Project
![Work in Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20progress-yellow)

The project study the anisotropy of the universe with galaxy scaling relations. We use the FLAMINGO simulation to create thousands of mock lightcones and see what level of cosmic anisotropy we can expect in a LCDM universe. 

The work is a continuation of observational studies from:
- [Migkas et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...636A..15M/abstract)
- [Migkas et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...649A.151M/abstract)

The universe might look more like a ðŸŒ° than a ðŸŽ±.

## TODOs
1. make sure 1728 samples are ready
2. rerun h0mc, bfmc
3. submit jobs for fit-all, best-fit, and rerun near-scan

- write, and run LT YT combined MCMC


## Warning

This repository is a **working directory** for my ongoing research on the anisotropy of the universe using the FLAMINGO simulation. It is **not intended as a fully-developed package** or tool for general use. The code here is primarily for personal experimentation and may not be well-documented, optimized, or suitable for reuse by others.

If youâ€™re looking for a polished and reusable solution, this repository may not meet your expectations. However, you are welcome to explore the content and reach out with any questions, suggestions, or collaborations!
